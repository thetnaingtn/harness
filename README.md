# Harness

A reusable Go agentic platform for building LLM agents. Implements the
streaming agent loop, tool registry, session storage, compaction, and
token budgeting needed to run a multi-provider agent in production. BYO
concrete tools, BYO provider clients, BYO memory/knowledge-graph plugins.

> **Status: v0.1.0.** First tagged release. The `runtime` API
> surface may still shift in the v0.x line — pin your version.

## Why Harness

If you're building an LLM agent in Go, you'll find yourself rewriting
the same substrate over and over: a streaming think-act loop,
parallel tool dispatch, prompt-cache-stable request building,
summarize-and-splice context compaction, JSONL session storage,
MCP-server glue. **That substrate is what Harness is.**

It treats the runtime — the orchestration / context / execution
layer — as the strategic infrastructure, not as plumbing to be
hidden behind a DSL or a graph builder. You own the loop you ship.
You can read every line.

It is **not** a CLI, a UI, a hosted runtime, or a framework with
opinions about how your agents should be deployed. There is no
`harness` binary. You import packages, compose a `Runtime`, and call
`rt.Run(ctx, msg, nil)`.

## What Harness is for

Harness is well-suited to:

- **Coding agents** — terminal-integrated, IDE-adjacent, or
  repo-rooted assistants that read and write files, run shells, and
  call tools across many turns.
- **Infrastructure-automation agents** — agents that drive cloud
  APIs, internal tooling, or operational workflows where Go's
  deployment story (static binary, low memory, embeddable in
  existing services) is a real win.
- **Long-running autonomous loops** — daemons, cron-driven runners,
  multi-day tasks. The streaming loop, compaction, and JSONL
  session resume cover the substrate.
- **Local-first agents** — anything that needs to ship as a single
  binary, run without a Python interpreter, or embed inside another
  Go service.
- **Tool-heavy agents** — agents whose value comes from many tools
  (custom + MCP servers + skills), not from elaborate workflow
  logic.
- **Developer-tooling agents** — internal CLIs, build assistants,
  code-review bots, log-triage agents — where a small dependency
  tree and predictable runtime matter.

The operational profile of Go matters here: static binaries,
low memory footprint, native concurrency primitives, and the
ability to embed the agent inside a service you already own. Harness
leans into all of these.

## When Harness is the wrong fit

Harness deliberately doesn't try to be a graph orchestrator, a
multi-role agent crew, a RAG-first knowledge platform, or a
notebook-style experimentation toolkit. If your problem is one of
these, you'll be fighting the grain:

- **Visual or declarative workflows** — agents whose value comes
  from inspectable graphs of explicit steps with branching, joins,
  checkpointing, and human-in-the-loop pauses.
- **Role-based multi-agent crews** — "researcher / writer /
  reviewer" decompositions where the framework's main value is
  coordinating personas.
- **RAG-first products** — anything where the bulk of the work is
  document ingest, chunking, embedding, indexing, and retrieval.
  Harness has no opinion about your knowledge layer.
- **Notebook / research workflows** — fast iteration in a Python
  notebook with the latest open-source ML libraries arriving daily.
- **Heavily regulated enterprise orchestration** — workflows that
  need replayability, RBAC, governance dashboards, and visual
  compliance views as first-class.

You can build any of these on top of Harness, but you'd be writing
a lot. The package is optimized for the use cases above, not these.

## Requirements

- **Go 1.25.1 or newer.** The module declares `go 1.25.1` and uses
  `iter.Seq` from `iter` (Go 1.23+) plus a few stdlib calls that
  hardened in 1.25. Older toolchains will fail at `go build`.
- **An LLM API key**, depending on which provider(s) you wire in:
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, Google ADC for Gemini, or a
  Qwen DashScope key. For local models, point `openai.NewOpenAIProviderWithKind`
  at an Ollama endpoint — no key required.
- **Optional: an MCP server** for `tools/mcp` integrations (any
  binary that speaks the Model Context Protocol — `npx
  @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem`, etc.).

## Install

```bash
go get github.com/sausheong/harness@latest
```

The library has no submodules — every package is importable directly.
The `tools/` subpackages are individually importable so you can pull
in only what you need (e.g. `tools/file` without `tools/browser`).

## Quick start

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "os"

    "github.com/sausheong/harness/providers/anthropic"
    "github.com/sausheong/harness/runtime"
    "github.com/sausheong/harness/session"
    "github.com/sausheong/harness/tool"
    "github.com/sausheong/harness/tools/bash"
    "github.com/sausheong/harness/tools/file"
)

func main() {
    reg := tool.NewRegistry()
    reg.Register(&file.ReadFileTool{WorkDir: "/tmp/work"})
    reg.Register(&bash.BashTool{WorkDir: "/tmp/work"})

    rt, err := runtime.BuildRuntime(
        runtime.RuntimeDeps{},
        runtime.RuntimeInputs{
            Provider: anthropic.NewAnthropicProvider(os.Getenv("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"), ""),
            Tools:    reg,
            Session:  session.NewSession("demo", "main"),
        },
        runtime.AgentSpec{
            ID:           "demo",
            Name:         "Demo",
            Model:        "anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5-20251001",
            Workspace:    "/tmp/work",
            SystemPrompt: "You are a helpful coding assistant.",
            MaxTurns:     25,
        },
    )
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    defer rt.Close() // releases MCP sessions if any were declared

    events, _ := rt.Run(context.Background(), "list files in workspace", nil)
    for ev := range events {
        if ev.Type == runtime.EventTextDelta {
            fmt.Print(ev.Text)
        }
    }
}
```

See [`examples/minimal/`](./examples/minimal) for the runnable
end-to-end version, and [`developer.md`](./developer.md) for
how to plug in hooks, MCP servers, skills, permissions, and more.

## Examples

Four end-to-end agents ship in [`examples/`](./examples). Each is a
self-contained `main.go` you can `go run`:

| Example | What it shows | API surface |
|---|---|---|
| [`minimal/`](./examples/minimal) | Smallest useful agent — file + bash + web tools, REPL, streaming output. ~80 lines. | `tool.Registry`, `session.Session`, `anthropic.NewAnthropicProvider`, `runtime.BuildRuntime` |
| [`data-agent/`](./examples/data-agent) | BYO custom tools (no `tools/*` deps) hitting Singapore's open-data APIs (`data.gov.sg`). Includes a `//go:build live` smoke test. | `tool.Tool` interface for 5 custom HTTP-backed tools |
| [`lta-agent/`](./examples/lta-agent) | Same shape as data-agent, talks to LTA Datamall. Demonstrates `IsConcurrencySafe=true` for parallel HTTP fanout. | Custom tools + parallel dispatch via `MaxToolConcurrency` |
| [`support-agent/`](./examples/support-agent) | Mock customer-support agent showing **`SkillProvider` + `PermissionChecker` + `LifecycleHooks`** wired together. KB articles via `//go:embed`; supervisor-mode gating; JSONL audit log. Closest to a real product. | All of the above, plus `runtime.SkillProvider`, `tool.PermissionChecker`, `runtime.LifecycleHooks` (`AfterToolUse` + `OnStop`) |
| [`self-improving-agent/`](./examples/self-improving-agent) | Wires `tool/memory` + `tool/skills` + `runtime.Review` end-to-end. The agent curates its own memory and skill library at end of every turn via `LifecycleHooks.OnStop`. Storage at `~/.harness/self-improving-agent/`. | `memory.MemoryTool`, `skills.SkillTool`, `runtime.Review`, `LifecycleHooks.OnStop` |

To run any of them:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
go run ./examples/minimal
go run ./examples/support-agent
# etc.
```

The `lta-agent` additionally needs `LTA_DATAMALL_KEY`. The
`support-agent` honours `--supervisor` (or
`SUPPORT_AGENT_SUPERVISOR=1`) to unlock write tools and
`SUPPORT_AGENT_AUDIT_LOG=path/to/audit.jsonl` to redirect the audit
trail.

## Configuration

Three environment variables tune the runtime when you don't override
them via `LoopConfig`:

| Variable | Default | What it controls |
|---|---|---|
| `HARNESS_MAX_TOOL_CONCURRENCY` | `10` | Max parallel tool calls within a concurrency-safe batch |
| `HARNESS_MAX_AGENT_DEPTH` | `3` | Max subagent recursion depth (a child at depth N can spawn at N+1) |
| `HARNESS_STREAMING_TOOLS` | unset (off) | When `"1"`, concurrency-safe tools start executing while the model is still streaming text — latency win for I/O-bound tools |

`LoopConfig` field values win over env vars when set. Set the field
to its zero value (or omit it) to fall back to env, then to defaults.

Everything else (provider API keys, model selection, workspace path,
skill paths, etc.) is your config's responsibility — harness reads
none of it.

## Components

A general agent harness has ~16 conceptual components: the loop, the
model invocation layer, the tool registry, permission gating,
context/compaction, the system prompt, sub-agents, hooks, MCP, skills,
session persistence, writable memory, writable skills, a
self-improvement reviewer, UI, and entrypoints. harness implements the
in-process, library-shaped subset of those. The rest is left to the
caller — you own the binary, you own the UI, you own the channel.

| # | Component | Where it lives in harness |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Agent loop** | `runtime.Runtime.Run()` — single goroutine, streaming-first; `<-chan ChatEvent` |
| 2 | **Model invocation** | `llm.Provider` interface + `ChatStream`; non-streaming fallback retries the same `ChatRequest` byte-for-byte to preserve the prompt-cache prefix |
| 3 | **Tool registry & schemas** | `tool.Registry`; `ToolDefs()` is sorted by name so the request prefix is stable across turns (cache hit) |
| 4 | **Tool execution & permissions** | `tool.PermissionChecker` (`Check` + `FilterToolDefs`); concurrency-safe partitioning via `Tool.IsConcurrencySafe` + `LoopConfig.MaxToolConcurrency` (default 10) |
| 5 | **Context & compaction** | `compaction.Manager` — summarize-and-splice at a clean user-message boundary; tool-result pruning at request time |
| 6 | **System prompt assembly** | `llm.SystemPromptPart` — splits the static cacheable prefix from the per-turn dynamic suffix; provider-side `cache_control` placement is automatic |
| 7 | **Sub-agents / delegation** | `runtime.SubagentResolver` interface + `MaxAgentDepth=3` cap; subagents run as in-process goroutines with their own `Runtime` |
| 8 | **Hooks** | `runtime.LifecycleHooks` (on `LoopConfig.Hooks`): `OnUserPromptSubmit`, `OnSessionStart`, `BeforeToolUse`, `AfterToolUse`, `OnStop`. Go callbacks — type-safe, in-process, nil-friendly |
| 9 | **MCP** | `tools/mcp` package: `mcp.Connect(ctx, ServerConfig)` adapts an external MCP server's tools as `tool.Tool`s. Declare `AgentSpec.MCPServers` for auto-wiring; `Runtime.Close()` releases sessions |
| 10 | **Skills** | `runtime.SkillProvider` (`FormatIndex` + `Get`); auto-registers `load_skill` so the model can pull a skill on demand. See `examples/support-agent/` for a `//go:embed kb/*.md` example |
| 11 | **Session persistence** | `session.Session` (in-memory, append-only) + optional `session.Store` for JSONL persistence and cross-process resume |
| 12 | **Writable memory** | `tool/memory` package: `MemoryStore` interface, `MemoryTool` (action-discriminated), JSONL on-disk default. Wraps any backend; `*jsonl.Store` doubles as a `runtime.MemoryProvider`. |
| 13 | **Writable skills** | `tool/skills` package: `SkillStore` interface, `SkillTool` (six actions: create/patch/replace/remove/list/get), directory-on-disk default. Patch supports surgical string-match with three error categories. |
| 14 | **Self-improvement reviewer** | `runtime.Review` — one-shot reviewer Runtime against a finished session. Designed to be called from `LifecycleHooks.OnStop` in a goroutine. Snapshots parent's session; shares Memory/Skills writes; recursion guard via `AgentID = "__review__"`. |

Deliberately not in scope (numbers from the same conceptual list):

- **15 — UI**: harness emits events; the caller renders.
- **16 — Entrypoints**: harness is a library. There is no `harness`
  binary. The example agents in `examples/` show how a binary is
  assembled.

## Design notes

- **Streaming-first.** The loop yields `EventTextDelta`,
  `EventToolCallStart`, `EventToolResult`, `EventDone`, and friends
  through a `<-chan ChatEvent`. There is no buffered "give me the
  whole response" path — even the non-streaming fallback re-emits
  through the same channel.
- **Prompt-cache discipline.** Tool definitions are sorted, system
  prompt parts are split into cached/dynamic blocks, and
  `buildMessageParams` is a pure function (proven by
  `TestBuildMessageParamsIsPure` in
  `providers/anthropic/anthropic_test.go`). The non-streaming retry
  path depends on byte-identical params to keep the cache prefix
  valid.
- **Compaction at a clean boundary.** `compaction.Split` walks
  backward counting user messages and cuts at one — never inside a
  tool-call/tool-result pair. The prompt (`compaction/prompt.go`)
  emits a 9-section structured summary inside an `<analysis>` +
  `<summary>` envelope; the `<analysis>` block is stripped before
  re-injection.
- **Plug-points are nil-friendly.** `MemoryProvider`,
  `KnowledgeGraph`, `SkillProvider`, `SubagentResolver`,
  `PermissionChecker`, `LifecycleHooks`, and `session.Store` are all
  optional. Pass `nil` (or leave the field zero) and the corresponding
  feature disappears with no degraded behaviour.
- **Hooks are Go callbacks, not shell scripts.** `LifecycleHooks`
  fires `OnUserPromptSubmit` (may rewrite the prompt),
  `OnSessionStart`, `BeforeToolUse` (may deny like a
  `PermissionChecker`), `AfterToolUse`, and `OnStop` (with reason:
  `completed | max_turns | error | aborted`). Hooks run synchronously
  on the runtime goroutine — keep them quick.
- **MCP is just another tool source.** `mcp.Connect` returns a
  `Client` whose `Tools()` are regular `tool.Tool`s namespaced as
  `mcp__<server>__<tool>`. Either register them yourself or declare
  `AgentSpec.MCPServers` and let `BuildRuntime` wire them in. Stdio
  (`Command + Args`) and Streamable HTTP (`URL` + optional `Headers`
  / `HTTPClient`) are both supported via the official
  `github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk`. For OAuth, pass an
  `oauth2.NewClient(ctx, tokenSource)` (or
  `clientcredentials.Config.Client(ctx)`) as `HTTPClient` —
  auto-refresh comes for free. Call `Runtime.Close()` to release
  sessions.
- **Four providers, one interface.** Anthropic, OpenAI (and
  OpenAI-compatible / local Ollama), Gemini, and Qwen ship built-in.
  Adding a fifth is implementing `llm.Provider` (~300 LOC).

See [`developer.md`](./developer.md) for a step-by-step guide to
building agents on top of Harness, including diagrams of the
composition surface and the per-Run loop.

## Non-goals

The list of things harness deliberately does **not** do is as much
part of its design as the list of things it does. If you need any of
these, you'll need to bring them yourself or layer them on top:

- **A binary or CLI.** harness is a library. The `examples/` agents
  show how a binary is assembled — pick the one closest to your
  shape and copy it.
- **A UI or TUI.** The runtime emits `<-chan AgentEvent`; rendering
  is the caller's job. Wire it to stdout, a TUI, a websocket, an
  HTTP SSE endpoint, a Slack adapter — whatever you need.
- **Channel adapters.** No WhatsApp / Telegram / Slack / Discord
  bridges. Harness doesn't know what a "channel" is — it speaks
  `(userMsg, images) → events`. Build the bridge in your own
  binary.
- **Hot-reload of MCP servers mid-Run.** MCP servers are connected
  at `BuildRuntime` time. To add or replace one, build a new
  Runtime.
- **Server-side MCP.** The `tools/mcp` package is client-side only —
  it consumes other servers' tools. Exposing harness's tools as an
  MCP server for other agents is a future addition, not a current
  feature.
- **A skill / plugin marketplace.** Skills are `//go:embed` markdown
  in your binary, or whatever your `SkillProvider` resolves at
  runtime. There is no central registry.
- **Auth / billing / multi-tenant infrastructure.** Per-agent
  policy lives in `PermissionChecker`; everything else is your
  problem.
- **Shell-command hooks.** Hooks are typed Go callbacks on
  `LifecycleHooks`, not subprocess invocations driven by a config
  file.

## Testing

```bash
go test ./...        # unit tests for every package
go vet ./...         # static checks
go build ./...       # all packages + examples compile
```

Live integration tests (the ones that hit real APIs) are gated
behind the `live` build tag so the default `go test ./...` stays
hermetic:

```bash
LTA_DATAMALL_KEY=... go test -tags live ./examples/lta-agent/...
```

The runtime test suite includes some rare timing-sensitive cases —
if a streaming-tools test flakes once, re-run before treating it as
a real failure.

## Status

`v0.1.0` is the first tagged release. The v0.x line follows Go
module semver: minor bumps may break API, patch bumps are bug-fix
only. Pin your dependency:

```bash
go get github.com/sausheong/harness@v0.1.0
```

Likely sources of v0.x churn before a v1.0.0:

- `RuntimeDeps` / `RuntimeInputs` / `AgentSpec` field names may
  shift as new optional plug-points land.
- New `LifecycleHooks` callbacks may be added (additive, but watch
  for new fields if you construct the struct positionally — use
  named fields).
- The `tools/mcp` package's `ServerConfig` may grow new fields for
  the MCP-spec OAuth handshake.

See [GitHub releases](https://github.com/sausheong/harness/releases)
for the changelog of each tagged version.
