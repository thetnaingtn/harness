//  3. Otherwise off.

// Strict "1" for the env fallback (rather than truthy parsing) keeps the
// env contract simple and matches Claude Code's binary-feature-gate posture.
// Note: an explicit `false` in JSON5 behaves the same as the field being
// absent — to disable, leave both unset.

// live EventToolResult (via r.emitToolResult); the main goroutine consumes
// this struct post-stream to write the paired session entries (ToolCall +
// ToolResult) IN STREAM ORDER, AFTER the assistant text is saved.
//
// Deferring session writes to the main goroutine preserves the API
// invariant that every tool_result message follows an assistant message
// containing the matching tool_use. Phase D's parallelism win (tools
// running during the stream) is preserved because Execute still happens
// inside the kickoff goroutine.

// entries in stream order.)
