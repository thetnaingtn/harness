// seen K of them, the next encountered user message is the cutoff. Everything
// from that user message forward is preserved verbatim; everything before is
// the to-be-compacted range.
//
// ok is false when the path contains <= K user messages — there is no cutoff
// that preserves K turns. Caller should refuse to compact rather than over-
// compacting.

// A user message is always a clean boundary by construction in Felix's
// runtime (user msg → assistant text → tool_call → tool_result → next user
// msg). Splitting before a user message therefore never orphans a tool pair.
